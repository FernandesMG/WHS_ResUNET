# MAASTRO Lung 1 cardiac contouring results

This archive contains the cardiac contours of the publicly available MAASTRO Lung 1 dataset as predicted by the ResUnet model v1.0.0 trained in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer data from Radiotherapy planning Computed Tomography images acquired at Radboud University Medical Center as described in Fernandes et al. (2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2021.10.008). Both the results of the original model (before active learning) and of the fine tuned model (after active learning) are presented in GIF format with the contours overlayed over the original CT. The former can be found in WHS_ResUNET/results_MAASTRO_manuscript/Test Set/ and the latter in WHS_ResUNET/results_MAASTRO_manuscript/. The contoured structures are the following: heart, left and right atrium, left and right ventricle, aorta, pulmonary artery, and superior and inferior vena cava.
